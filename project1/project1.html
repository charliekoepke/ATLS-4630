            <h1>Class Portal</h1>
            <p>The objective of this lab was to start creating a class portal that will house all of the projects for the course. I decided to make my portal similar to the layout of a WordPress website. In the rough sketch of the wireframe I did, I included a “Projects” page, an “About Me” page, and also a link to my progress blog. I might include more pages, but I feel that just these pages are a good start.</p>
            <p>On the main home page, I want to highlight a few projects that are either the most recent ones, or the ones that I like the most, or am the most proud of. I will also include a little course description, if a user scrolls down the page, that just describe the course and gives a general summary of my personal takeaway from the course as well. The section will be a work-in-progress until I finish the course and can include more insightful takeaways.</p>
